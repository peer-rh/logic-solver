Using Logical Equivalence to refactor logical statements


- This project uses logical congruence to refactor logical statements using L_And, L_or, and L_neg
- Currently it uses bruteforce method, but optimisation will be implemented


## Ideas
- Represent As Heap Structure to Make parallel computing easier
- Implement Path finding to not brute force all options
