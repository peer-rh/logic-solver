# logic-solver

Using Logical Equivalence to refactor logical statements

- This project uses logical congruence to refactor logical statements using L_And, L_or, and L_neg
- Currently it uses bruteforce method, but optimisation will be implemented

## Ideas

- Make Multi Threaded
- Add find strategies
  - Only keep best
  - Bruteforce
  - Natural Selection
