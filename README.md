Using Logical Equivalence to refactor logical statements

- This project uses logical congruence to refactor logical statements using L_And, L_or, and L_neg
- Currently it uses bruteforce method, but optimisation will be implemented

## Ideas

- Represent As Heap Structure to Make parallel computing easier
- Implement find duplicates to make code easier
